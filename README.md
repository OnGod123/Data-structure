# Algorithm Time Complexities

This README provides examples and explanations for various algorithm time complexities.

## O(1) - Constant Time Complexity

The algorithm has a constant time complexity, meaning its runtime does not depend on the input size.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void constantTimeExample(int arr[], size_t size) {
    // Accessing the first element of the array
    int element = arr[0];
    printf("First element: %d\n", element);
}

int main() {
    int array[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    size_t size = sizeof(array) / sizeof(array[0]);
    constantTimeExample(array, size);

    return 0;
}

## Big O Notation

Big O notation is used to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. It provides an upper bound on the growth rate of the algorithm's time or space complexity.

[Add your detailed explanation about Big O notation.]

## Sorting Algorithms Animations

[Add a brief description or link to sorting algorithm animations.]

## 15 Sorting Algorithms in 6 Minutes

[Add a brief description or link to the video showing 15 sorting algorithms in 6 minutes. Include a warning about seizure/epilepsy triggers.]
